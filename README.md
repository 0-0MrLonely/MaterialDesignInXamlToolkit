# Material Design Colors In XAML Toolkit

Google Material Design Colors Swatches Specified in XAML

# What's Included?

 * XAML Resources for Google swatches displayed [here](http://www.google.co.uk/design/spec/style/color.html#color-ui-color-application)
 * Small sample apps showing how to include chosen colours and use the resources:
   * WPF
   * WinRT
 * Hacky console app which was used to generate the XAML
 
# Why?

I intend to create a Material Design TabControl theme for [Dragablz](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz). The first step being getting hold of all the colours, but I guess the resources might come in handy to others.
